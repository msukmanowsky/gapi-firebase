# GAPI and Firebase Auth

An example of how to use GAPI and Firebase Auth together to authenticate users
and talk to Google APIs.

## Background

If you are trying to use [Google's JavaScript Library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/)
to query Google APIs (e.g. Google Analytics), you'll run into an issue whereby
Firebase Auth is strictly intended for AuthN (fetching a user's identity and
not AuthZ (authorizing a user to access specific resources).

The access token that Firebase Auth provides _is valid_ for whatever scopes
a user approved, but Firebase Auth does not provide any means to see the
access token upon, say, token refreshes. This is
[by design](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/issues/294).

Google's JavaScript Library transparently handles token refreshes but
will also provide access to the updated token via:

```javascript
const auth2 = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance()
auth2.isSignedIn.listen(isSignedIn => {
  if (isSignedIn) {
    const currentUser = auth2.currentUser.get()
    const authResponse = currentUser.getAuthResponse(true)
    authResponse.id_token
    authResponse.access_token
  }
})
```

These same credentials can also be used to authorize a user to Firebase!

```javascript
const credential = firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
  authResponse.id_token,
  authResponse.access_token
)
firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(credential)
```

There are some additional concerns to keep in mind like signing out of both
`gapi` and `firebase`:

```javascript
const auth2 = gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance()
auth2.signOut()
  .then(() => { return firebase.auth().signOut() })
```

Now you have the best of both worlds, the ability to make requests to any
Google API via `gapi` and an authenticated `firebase` client to communicate
with firebase APIs.

## Running this example:

1. Clone this repo locally.
1. [Sign up](https://firebase.google.com) for a Firebase app.
1. [Enable](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) the "Analytics
API" for Firebase project.
1. Find the [OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
firebase auto-created on setup and ensure your server's origin is listed in
"Authorised JavaScript origins" (should be something like
  `http://localhost:8000`, but depends on your server config).
1. Search the source code for `//OVERWRITE ME` and fill in your relevant
configuration.
1. Run your webserver (Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` is a
great choice) and open the page.
1. Open up your browser's dev console and check logging messages.
1. Click login!
